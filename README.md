# PublishOnNostr
## A simple Chrome Extension to publish an image on your Nostr client with just one click. ##

This extension gives you a new item in the context-menu you have when you right click on an image. This new item is called "Public on Nostr".

It simply copies the img URL, opens the default Nostr client you specified in the Settings, pastes the URL in the text-area, and submit.
All in one step, a simple click on the context-menu item.

*Attention: the extension is still not working. It gives you the new "Publish on Nostr" item and currently open https://snort.social/, but it does NOT paste the URL and so it does NOT publish yet.
<br>I need to figure out how to make this thing work and how to create a Settings page in which the user can specify its preferred Nostr webclient.*

This extension has been created with the help of ChatGPT by OpenAI.
