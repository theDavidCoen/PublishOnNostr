# PublishOnNostr
## A simple Chrome Extension to publish an image on your Nostr client with just one click. ##

This extension gives you a new item in the context-menu you have when you right click on an image. This new item is called "Public on Nostr".

It simply copies the img URL, opens the default Nostr client you specified in the Settings, pastes the URL in the text-area, and submit.
All in one step, a simple click on the context-menu item.


This extension has been created with the help of ChatGPT by OpenAI.
